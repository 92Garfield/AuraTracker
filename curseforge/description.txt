# AuraBars - Custom Buff and Debuff Tracking Addon for World of Warcraft

**Advanced Buff and Debuff Tracking with Customizable Display**

---

## Features

### Five Independent AuraBars

Each bar can be configured independently to display different aura types with precise filtering options.

### Advanced Filtering System

- **Blizzard API Filters** - Query helpful (buffs), harmful (debuffs), player-cast, raid-relevant, cancelable, and Maw auras
- **Special Filters** - Pre-combat filter, permanent aura filter, consumable filter
- **Aura Groups** - Create custom spell ID groups and filter to show only or exclude specific auras
- **Weapon Enchants** - Toggle display of temporary weapon enchant auras

### Customization Options

Access the options panel via:
- ESC → Interface → AddOns → AuraTracker

Each bar can be configured independently:

- **Enable/Disable Toggle** - Split Buffs and Debuffs into up to 5 bars (let me know if you need more)
- **Combat Visibility** - Option to show bars only when in combat
- **Tooltips** - Optional tooltip display on hover
- **Size Control** - Adjustable icon size
- **Layout** - Configure columns and grow direction
- **Positioning** - X/Y offset controls with anchor point selection
- **Background Display** - To see which area auras may cover, while adjusting position and layout

### Blizzard BuffFrame Control

Option to hide the default Blizzard buff frame for a cleaner UI.

## Important Note - WoW Midnight Restrictions

Due to restrictions in World of Warcraft (introduced in patch 12.0), addons **cannot access aura information during restricted content** such as combat or Mythic+ dungeons.

To work around this limitation, AuraTracker:
- Caches aura information obtained before entering restricted content
- Continues displaying long-duration buffs (consumables, raid buffs, etc.) that were active before combat
- Uses Blizzard's built-in filtering system to query available aura data

This means the addon works best for tracking pre-applied buffs and will have limited functionality for tracking combat-specific debuffs or short-duration effects during active combat in Mythic+ or similar content.
